### Setup

### Project objectives

- You should have a page title in an `h1` element with an id of title
- You should have a short explanation in a `p` element with an id of description
- You should have a `form` element with an id of survey-form
- Inside the `form` element, you are required to enter your name in an `input` field that has an id of name and a type of text
- Inside the `form` element, you are required to enter your email in an `input` field that has an id of email
- If you enter an email that is not formatted correctly, you will see an HTML5 validation error
- Inside the `form`, you can enter a number in an `input` field that has an id of number
- The number `input` should not accept non-numbers, either by preventing you from typing them or by showing an HTML5 validation error (depending on your browser).
- If you enter numbers outside the range of the number `input`, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error
- For the name, email, and number `input` fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the `form`, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label"
- For the name, email, and number `input` fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field
- Inside the `form` element, you should have a `select` dropdown element with an id of dropdown and at least two options to choose from
- Inside the `form` element, you can select an `option` from a group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute
- Inside the `form` element, you can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute
- Inside the `form` element, you are presented with a `textarea` for additional comments
- Inside the `form` element, you are presented with a `button` with id of submit to submit all the inputs
