### Setup

- Create an `index.html` file
- Create a `styles.css` file
- Link your CSS file in the `<head>` of your HTML document
- Write your code

### Project objectives

- Your product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`.
- You can see an image within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"` (A logo would make a good image here).
- Within the `#header` element, you can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`.
- You can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`.
- When you click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
- You can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`.
- Your landing page has a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`.
- Within the form, there is an input field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address.
- The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for.
- The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
- Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding `id="submit"`.
- When you click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: `https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit`).
- The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
- Your product landing page should have at least one media query.
- Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
